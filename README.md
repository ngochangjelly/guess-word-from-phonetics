# ipa-rest-api

International Phonetic Alphabet RESTful API for words

This project will consist of creating a REST API that will provide 2 things

- Return the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
- Return the phonetic equivalent of a word

As a reference we will use the IPA Alphabet listed on wikipedia :

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_French

We will also use collinsdictionary.com in order to obtain the phonetic result of a word.

### How do I get set up?

1. Make sure you have Node JS installed (Download here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
2. Make sure you have Redis installed (Download here: http://redis.io/download)
3. Clone the repo into chosen directory and move to that directory
4. Run the following commands

```
npm install
redis-cli < data/alphabet_import.sh
```

5. Launch the Redis client using redis-cli and add a secret key that will be used for the JSON Web Tokens :

```
SET jwt:secret <enter secret key here>
```

6. Generate a JSON Web Token by running the following command with a desired email (This way you can restrict the API usage in order to prevent abuse)

```
node scripts/token.js <enter email address>
```

The tokens and their information will be stored in redis, you can see the list of keys by accessing the set with name jwt:tokens.

7. Start the app server by running the following command :

```
node server.js
```

8. You can make API calls in order to retrieve information. Make sure to add `Authorization` key to the header with the value `Bearer <token>` (`Bearer`, followed by a space, followed by your token.)

Example :

```
$ curl -X GET  http://localhost:3000/ipa/en/hello -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
{"language":"en","word":"hello","phonetic":"heloʊhɛˈləʊ,"}
```

### API

#### Alphabet

```
GET localhost:3000/alphabet/fr
```

Which returns :

```
[
  {
    "IPA": "e",
    "Examples": "clé, les, chez, aller, pied, journée",
    "Type": "Oral vowels"
  },
  {
    "IPA": "s",
    "Examples": "sans, ça, assez",
    "Type": "Consonants"
  },
  {
    "IPA": "ˈ",
    "Examples": "moyen [mwaˈjɛ̃]",
    "Type": "Suprasegmentals"
  },
  ...
```

#### IPA

```
GET localhost:3000/ipa/fr/ordinateur
```

Which returns :

```
{
  "language": "fr",
  "word": "ordinateur",
  "phonetic": "ɔʀdinatœʀ"
}
```

For local development, if you don't want to perform points 1 & 2, I experimented with Otto as a development tool (You can download it here : https://www.ottoproject.io/downloads.html).
I was able to make the development environnment work following the following commands : https://github.com/hashicorp/otto/issues/496#issuecomment-230084747

Then if you ssh in the vagrant machine, you can basically execute the rest of the steps in the vagrant.

- Dependencies

All the package dependencies are located in package.json file
